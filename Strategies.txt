# (cat) Kunkka:

1/ Hero's strengths:

- Kunkka does extremely well agaisnt teams that like to bundle up together like
  Hunters, Mages thanks to his "ghost ship" AOE skill. And since he often forms
  a Warrior team, he performs best against Hunters.
- Warriors excels in expanding existing leads but lacks damage and falters
  later. Kunkka being a Human pairs very well with Lycan who is also a
  Human/Warrior. Combining with one more Human, Warriors team can accumulate
  experience advantage, available choices are:
  + KOTL: AOE magic damage
  + Lina: single magical burst
  + CM: mana advantage, using skills before opponents
  + LC: using Warriors' leads to build up damage and transition later.
  + OmniKnight: heal and damage (not recommended)
  + DragonKnight: damage (not recommended)

2/ Hero's weaknesses:

- Kunkka's dependence on "ghost ship" to deal damage coupled with "ghost
  ship"'s delay means he is not very effective versus Nagas and Knights (high
  magic resistance) and Assassins (dispersed team formation). Honorable
  mentioned of such counters:
  + Slark: Assassin, Naga
  + TramAnh: Assasin, reflection damage block works well against
    single-instanced damage
  + OmniKnight: Knight, heal sustains well against Warriors' low damage
  + Tide: Naga

# (cat) Assassin:

1/ Strengths:

- Assassins biggest advantage is the ability to leap to enemies's back lines
  and burst down their glass cannons. In order to really capitalize on this
  advantage, it is recommended that all chesspieces are placed at the bottom of
  the board to draw opponents' chesspieces forwards and make room for assassins
  to jump.
- Jumping Assassins also cause problems for AOE users like Terrorist, Gyro,
  Kunkka, KOTL, Grim, and Disruptor.
- Assassins work best against Hunters and Mages who like to stand behind front
  lines
- Assassins pair extremely well with Aqirs since there are already 2
  chesspieces with these synergies: Nyx and SandKing. Also, when Aqir synergy
  is activated, the newly spawn Assassins will get to do an extra jump.
- Melee Assassins should be placed as far as possible based on enemies'
  positioning (meaning they should be placed bottom left when enemies'
  chesspieces are on the left because when 2 teams engage, enemies will appear
  on the right) so they can jump straight to enemies' back line
- Ranged Assassins like Phuong Anh should be placed far away, but not too far
  (in this case, bottom right) so they can jump to left side of the board. They
  can still attack while standing behind melee Assassins.

2/ Weaknesses:

- Assassins' reliance on physical damage means they don't work well against
  high armored Warriors, their ability to leap is also negligible since all
  Warriors can face-tank.
- Elementals also counter Assassins since most Assassins are melee and will be
  petrified. All elementals also have high AOE magical burst, most noticeably
  Enigma and Razor who can nuke down Assassins who like to stay close to them.
- Assassins' game-winning ability - leaping - is also their demise versus team
  that know how to position. A team that clumps well together with the outer
  layer made of tankers and the inner of high AOE magical burst like Nevermore,
  Enigma, Techies can tear apart Assassin comp easily
